Weight Predictor
About the Project
The Weight Predictor is a machine learning model that predicts an individual's weight based on input features such as height, age, gender, and body physique. The model is built using Linear Regression to estimate weight based on these parameters.

Dataset
The dataset consists of personal attributes including:

Height: The individual's height in centimeters.
Age: The individual's age in years.
Gender: The individual's gender (e.g., Male/Female).
Body Physique: A measure or category describing the individual's body type (e.g., Slim, Average, Athletic).
Model
The model uses Linear Regression to make predictions about weight based on the features provided. The gender and body physique features are appropriately encoded to handle categorical data.

Key Features
Weight Prediction: Predict the weight based on age, height, gender, and body physique.
Data Preprocessing: Categorical variables such as gender and body physique are transformed before training the model.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Matplotlib
